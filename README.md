# Core--Smart-Watch
This is a design of a development board for SmartWatch. It is designed in Eagle Autodesk with SMD and through-hole components.

I have selected each component to make the microcontroller, battery charger, serial communication, etc work and to reduce overall production cost. It is capable of performing some basic functions such as digital read/write, analog signals, I2C and UART communications, Bluetooth connection, RTC(real-time clock), and OLED display to set alarms and operate it easily.

The consumption of power in sleep mode is very low, around 1.3mA so the battery could last 2 days.
