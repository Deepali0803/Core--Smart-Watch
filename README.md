# Core--Smart-Watch
This is a design of development board for SmartWatch, designed in Eagle Autodesk with SMD and through-hole components.
It is capable of performing some basic functions such as digital read/write, analog signals, I2C and UART communications, with Bluetooth connection, RTC(real-time clock), and OLED display to set alarm and operate easily.

The power consumption in sleep mode is very low, around 1.3mA so the battery could last 2 days.
